            <h1>Welcome To Pizza Eats!</h1>
            Welcome to Pizza Eats, where the essence of Italy comes alive in every bite. Founded by two passionate Italian cousins, Antonio and Giulia, our pizzeria brings a taste of their homeland to your plate. Growing up in the heart of Naples, they developed a deep appreciation for authentic pizza, crafted with time-honored techniques and the finest ingredients. At Pizza Eats, we’ve translated that love into a menu bursting with traditional favorites and creative twists. Each pizza is made from scratch, using family recipes passed down through generations and a dedication to quality. Our mission is to offer you not just a meal, but an experience—one that captures the warmth, flavor, and joy of Italian dining. Join us at Pizza Eats and discover why every pizza is a celebration of Italian tradition. Buon appetito!                </section>
